title: "The day (first halloween story)"
---

It was a cold November morning, the sun was bright, but didn&#39;t heat up the ground. There was no wind, the otherwise cheerful beginning of the day felt heavy. Even the baristas behind the machine at the nearest coffee shop on the corner had felt the strange aura which had filled up the air. Every customer, every single person on the street was nervous.

Something will come, something bad, or this is just a usual Monday either way it was not pleasant for Natasha.



She was beautiful, average height, her body was more sporty than skinny, her long brown hair made a cover for her elvish looking face. She was a strong minded and calm sometimes cold and too powerful accountant for a local business which was selling hospitality equipment. Her eyes were light blue and every barista&#39;s heart melted when she look at them.

However, her whole presence was more like an angel, those pretty eyes held a secret. A dark and disturbing secret. She wasn&#39;t always on the top of her game. There was a time, when she couldn&#39;t get a grab on her life, her job was just too much and her husband wasn&#39;t ideal either.

Later with time the man left her, at least he wasn&#39;t around anymore, and she become happier each day, start every day with running and get focused on her job. Everyone, who know her a bit thought, she might just needed to get rid of her toxic relationship, and now she finally can bloom.



This morning however, put a lot of weight on her shoulder, when her phone start to vibrate, while she was paying for her morning coffee. She ignored the call, and payed for drink, while walking out from the shop, pressed the recall button, because never know, maybe it was something important. It was an immediate response for the call, but what she heard made her sick to the stomach. It was her husband, the man who left her, the person, who just disappeared from day to another. Her hands start to shaking, she hung up the call immediately. - &quot;There is a sick joke&quot;- she was telling herself.

\- It is impossible.

She knew she going to throw up. Quickly ran behind the corner and just when she reached the garbage bin in the alley, her breakfast find the way up her throat to see the sunlight again.

It took her maybe an hour while she could overcome her panic attack, and rushed to the office, she can&#39;t let her emotions distract her, she has a job to do, but when she reached her desk, there was a little brown upc box. There was a bit odd, because she wasn&#39;t expecting any delivery, but probably the security just mixed up the tables she thought.

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s a new guy…&quot;

&quot;Yes, that could be it.&quot;

&quot;A new security, probably in a night shift, who finished at the morning, that&#39;s why she haven&#39;t seen him, just same old George at the front desk.&quot;

Her heart skipped a beat, when she saw her own name on the label. There was no return address whatsoever…

The blood just left her face when she slowly opened the box and find a simple thing inside a black Teflon pipe tool, her husband loved to smoke his old stylish pipes, just like Sherlock Holmes… this tool, it was the same what she gave him for they anniversary.

It was absurd.

\- Why? Why now? – She asked, but the question remained unanswered.

She couldn&#39;t done any job, her heart was racing and her mind was already at home. When the clock reached 4.30 she bolted out from the office. Run down the stairs throughout the massive door of the building. Didn&#39;t even stop to catch a bus, nor the tube, she was power walking home. It took her about 50 minuets to reach the street where she lived. Her house was the far end of the street. She was walking faster and faster, she ended up sprinting to the door. Opened the door and left it wide open, she wasn&#39;t care anymore. Ran through the house, straight to the garden, and start to dig the ground with her bare hands. Spent 20 minutes consistently digging, and there was nothing. She couldn&#39;t find what she was looking for. Her tears was sliding across her face slowly, and she understand everything.



Like switch for the light, just click, and Natasha was no more, it was Rachel, the personality, who set up the phone call, who sent box for the morning, and who unburied the remains of Natasha&#39;s husband and sent it the police station, of course with some delay, because there was one thing what she has to do.

Wiped down the tears from her face, and walked to the shed, the rope was already prepared, how she left it…

\- &quot; I am sorry, my love…&quot; she whispered to the mirror in the shed..

When the police arrived her feet no longer touched ground, but they never forget the smiley on her face, what Rachel left for them…
