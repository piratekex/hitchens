title: "Skating and love"

---

I thought for a second post, I might introduce myself a bit more...
 I&#39;m skating a lot on the streets of London and I&#39;m using it as a secondary transportation.

I get the question a lot &quot;Are you not afraid to break yourself?&quot;.

Well, sometimes I am, but it still feels amazing, so I don&#39;t care.

Also don&#39;t mention the fact that once I almost killed myself with one of my signature drink experiments. So for me it doesn&#39;t matter, I am skating, cycling or just having a cup of coffee... it&#39;s the same risk with my life.

Then they continue &quot;Well at least the ladies probably like you&quot;.

It may be shocking, but no.

I don&#39;t know what it is with women, but if you&#39;re doing crazy sport, they look at you how you look at the dogs at the park: &quot;Cute, and love them till they are not yours...&quot;.

When you ask them out, you can see in their eyes, a little switch just turn on, and they become the best insurance analyst.

You can hear their thoughts:

&quot;This guy gonna kill himself in a few years, or worse paralyse himsef, I can&#39;t afford that&quot;

So they start to make excuses:

-  I forgot I have a boyfriend
-  I have to move back home this afternoon
-  I just remembered where I left my favourite t-shirt so I have to fly back to korea
-  I just realised I am a lesbian

Well probably it doesn&#39;t help that I look like a resurrected racoon from the pet cemetery, But I think this is just a side reason.
