title: "The lonely date"
---

It has been like a week or two since I mentioned that I am no longer in charge of my dating life. However, I don&#39;t really care that people seems like to know better what is good for me, so I have no questions.

A few days ago, while I was walking around my favourite part of the city and trying to kill the time till I could have a beer again after I spent a week taking antibiotics because of my injury. You know the feeling, when you are not allowed to drink, but somehow, you have to stop the shaking...

I was prepared, I had a book with me, my phone battery was charged up fully, so I could just walk and listen to some music till I can sit at the pub reading and drinking my beer, just like my grandfather did.

I was thinking about that cold bottle of sweet alcohol, when I received a call from my friend. He sounded quite happy, and I was about to find out very soon why. He was off to try to match me up with the lady he was talking about last time. I remembered that girl clearly, as clearly as I was paying attention to the conversation about her... so I haven&#39;t had a single clue.

Well alright, I said let&#39;s meet at the pub, I am not the man who gave up his alcholfull nectar for some random aranged date. I got the answer, my friend would call me back after he had made the other side of the arrangement.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but I have a hand injury, I am not working, why did he have to call me first? It&#39;s not like I have plans... okay, at that time a skander competition seemed a better idea. I told myself, at least to try my best. I looked at myself and because hell has moved to London in the past week and my penguin spirit was boiling in the sun, I saw my t-shirt looked like I had been swimming, but according to the smell I missed the lake and ended up in the sewer...

I looked for a nice spot with shade and chilled there a bit just to dry my shirt, than I headed back to the pub, because that was the time for me. The time of my well deserved pint of beer. I reached the pub in no time, it felt like I was floating all the way there, but maybe I just got hit by a bus and that gave me some speed...

The place was empty and recently they opened an outside area, which was so nice, I could sit in the shade, without feeling like I am at some sort of sauna. Other than the 3 homeless people per 20 minutes, it is a very lovely place and I felt at home. Drinking my beer, and reading my book. I was missing nothing, but after a few hours I had a feeling, the VIP guest of the evening would arrive soon. That feeling assassinated my desire to read any more of my book.

Another 45 minutes slowly gone, when I saw my friend appear on the horizon with his bike. I already knew, there would be no date that night...

When he arrived at the pub, I asked as nice as I could (it wasn&#39;t nice at all) &quot;Where is the girl?&quot;.

&quot;Oh, she already had some plans, so she can&#39;t make it today.&quot;

After that it was a good night, drinking beer and eating fast food with a friend, but the night did not end just there. While I started my long walk home, I found the perfect date for myself in the form of a cat. She was a lovely little lady. She walked to me and I sat down on curb and I was petting her and telling the unbelievable story of my day, she was listening and purring softly. Later a little fox appeared with a curious grin on his face. He probably thought I had some food for him, but my sweet companion stood up and started to growl and hiss till the intruder left.

I sat with her for another 15 minutes, then I give her a final hug and started to walk home while the sun was coming up slowly.

In the end it was a good night, but the iron is still quite funny, even the arranged dates aren&#39;t bullet proof if you look like someone who spent a century in the grave, and even smell like that...
