The love between me and "Walthamstow" is the same as between the butcher and the porks, seems smooth, but full of sharp edges. That is why I was not happy, after I had a sweet friday night drinking in Camden and I had to travel across the city. I walked to Euston staion, just to save some money, after spending like a king on drinks.

The first slap on my face came after, I asked someone who was working there as a supervisor, "Is there another train to Walthamstove central?". He answered with a short "Yes" then showed me the way to the escalator. When I stepped off from the moving staircase, I found myself in front of Mr. Mission Impossible. You know, the guy with 6 walkietalkies, he told me there were no more trains, so I had to stand on the moving metal boxes, to get out, and find a different way home.
The memoires of the last occasion when I was walking home from central London, were still clear in my mind. It felt the same so many ways as Sam&#39;s long walk from the Shire to Mordor. My bag had the same weight as a hobbit, so I had my own Frodo as well...
However, I&#39;m a fan of walking at night, but the heavy atmosphere between two storms gave me doubts for that plan. So I did, what a normal person would, and waited for the night bus...

After waiting for centuries, the fat and red doubledecker arrived. I was looking for nice seat, far away from everyone. Luckily, other than a couple of people it was empty, so I sat down at the upper deck, just to have a better view of the sleepy saturday morning London, which was still full of the mist of alcohol and rain.
My luck didn&#39;t last long, because there was a group of 10, who happened to choose the same ride as me. They were traveling no more than 5 or 6 stops, but that was more than enough...

A member of the screaming 10 was curious enough about my music taste so started waving till I took off my headphones. I was tired and I am an ass, as you already know, so I simply asked with simple British elegance: "Whaaaa'?".
He wasn&#39;t offended, well I am not sure he was aware what was going on around him at all. He then asked the common questions in these days about my favourite band and song. Lately even homeless people are very curious about my music taste.
After a few sceonds, suddenly he become perfectly still and his eyes were looking in to one direction. He was mesmerised by my injured hand.
"What happened with your hand?" He asked.
"I fought with a fence, and I lost." I answered.
That was a dumb move from my side, he got more curious, and wanted to know the details. He started guessing the cause of it. When I said the word &#39;sport&#39;, his eyes lit, like the eyes of a kid who just found the hidden halloween candy under the stairs.

"Were you cycling?"

"No, I was skating..."
 
"Like Tony Hawk?"

"No, I was inline skating."

The puzzled look on his face was promising, at least it seemed like he was on planet earth with us. I was full of hope. Hope to have the chance to go back to my horror podcast or listening to some music, because there wasn&#39;t any chance I could hear the voice of the narrator in that noise, but suddenly as the lightning struck he struck me with a request to teach him on the spot...
He had flown away again, far from this realm. He began to work on his made up skating lesson in the middle of the bus, asking for advice. In the meantime my patience was flying away slowly. A few moments later I was not in the mood to continue the conversation with the gent, but he had a few more key questions during his skating session.

"So, how you stop?"

"well, find a nice wall, and that will help..." I barked.

"Like this, right?" He pretended to be skateboarding while he was asking me that.

"No, that is not how you do it." I replied, now the tiredness took over the anger in my voice.

"Oh, so you don't know either. Probably that's why you injured your hand...";

I could not reply to that, because fortunately they reach their destanation and left under a few seconds. I was sitting with my tired and alcohol filled brain, and after I slowly realised what just happened I start to laugh. My anger had flown away. I turned my head and watched the dark buildings running away as the bus was speeding up.
The rest of my journey was peaceful. When I got off at my stop I found myself in front of the fence which made its marks on my hand. I felt the irony of the situation, a quick and silent smile ran across my face and faded away in a second like it was never there.
I was walking home slowly, looking at the foxes running across the street. Letting the alcohol slowly take over my mind for the last 15 minutes to my house. There was nothing to focus on anymore, my legs were doing their job without thinking. This was my friday night adventure...
