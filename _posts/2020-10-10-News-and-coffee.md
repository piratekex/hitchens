I have to apologise, I haven&#39;t written a single word for a while, not because there was nothing to share, but because I had no time to be honest. There are great stories like the &quot;The missing girl&quot; or &quot;The ride of the need&quot;, but these stories might come out in one post.

The reason behind the silence is simple: I decided to go back to school. You guys might be very surprised, but you can&#39;t beat the reaction of my family. I think some of them actually fainted.

However, I will spend my days in front of my laptop for the next 4 years, I&#39;ll try to write my stories as often as I can. In the last couple of months I have seen that many of you liked my stories. As I mentioned in the about section, the blog isn&#39;t just me, there is a good friend of mine, who keeps an eye on my grammar, and this makes the publishing a bit slow, but it is worth it.

I have also planned a lot of upgrades on the blog, but those require some time, which I don&#39;t really have lately, but I sacrifice every minute of my free time to create content. Therefore, I created a &quot;buy me a coffee&quot; page, where you can send some money to support us. The minimum payment is £5, which means one coffee for me and another flat white for my friend.

Also, soon you can forget the long and ugly domain of the blog, and use short, pretty one and leave comments under every post.

Right now, these are the main changes that are happening for the blog, but before these changes will take place, I have an announcement. We are almost at the middle of October, that means Halloween is upon us, therefore I will test my skills and write a couple of dark stories to entertain everyone.

Also, everyone who has a little creativity and would like to share it, just simply has to write a maximum 2 (A4) pages long, spooky story with the classic Times New Roman font, and the size of the font can not be bigger or smaller than 14. When it is ready, just simply have to send it to me ([piratekex@yahoo.com](mailto:piratekex@yahoo.com) ) for the subject write &quot;Halloween\_2020&quot;.

You can send your stories up until 27th October, we will read all of your tales and choose 3 and I will publish those 3 on 30th morning and you can vote till 1st November morning. The author of the most popular story will receive a prize on the following week.

Now, the fun part, because I don&#39;t like to post just dry information, here is a short tale about me and my lactose intolerance…

So, recently I started to feel uncomfortable when I drank milk. I am not sure, but I assume that is the sign of lactose intolerance, which is a nasty thing. Every time you drink milk you have to run, and not for fun...

The day I found out, I was monitoring myself and drinking just a little amount of milk, but I had an appointment for a job interview in central London. I felt good and healthy, but after a few hours I wandered into a coffee shop, for a couple of flat whites...

...Later, I was just standing in the middle of Camden and thinking about having a pint in my favourite pub, but my stomach had a different plan. The decision made in a matter of a seconds, and I was on my bike, pedalling for the life of my pants…

I was racing with the time, speeding past the cars and there was nothing that could stop me, but in the greatest danger, I still kept my sense of humour.

While I was passing the Finsbury Park, there was another cyclist with a road bike. I saw, you know that fancy 10 speed. The look on his face was simple, he wanted to be the fastest. He was checking on me every second. The moment he was next to me I just asked a simple question:

&quot;- You have diarrhoea too??&quot;

I haven&#39;t seen anyone slow down that fast before. He just pulled both of his breaks and vanished. I hope he didn&#39;t crash or something…

I burst out laughing. That little moment made my day. I didn&#39;t get the job, but at least I had some fun, and before you ask, yes, I got home in time...
