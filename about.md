Hi, it is me the writer of this blog. I thought I would clarify some things with the blog, and how and why I&#39;ve made it.

I made my own life a living hell. I fucked up my life. I got depression, and had really bad days/weeks/months, and you know sometimes you just can&#39;t see the reality around you. I was there and I did dumb things, and I will tell these stories in my own sarcastic and asshole way slowly in my posts, but yes I am down in a pit.

Before you ask, no this blog is not my cure for that. I spent so many months alone and dealing with drinking, and then I started to slowly get better, I have no idea what caused the change or if I am going to fall back and, to be fair, I don&#39;t give a shit.
What I realised during the lockdown in 2020 summer is thath I am a huge sarcastic piece of shit, and I wanna share that with the wole world.

Why?
I don&#39;t know, there are a lot of people who are judging me. Why can&#39;t I judge them?
Of course there are a lot of good people around me, and one of them is the girl who asks nothing to correct my shit grammar, and makes this blog possible, and many more who will sometimes show up in different stories.
So basically, this blog is my life, my stories, thoughts, comments on the world, and it is made for everyone who enjoys it, because life is just a joke.

Because of that, this blog is not advertised properly it is just shared between people. So if you like it, please share with your friends or enemies.

Thank you!
